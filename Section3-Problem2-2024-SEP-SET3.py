n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(f"|{' '*i}\\{' '*(n-i-1)}|")

#Another method:


# n=int(input())

# pre=0
# post=n-1

# for i in range(n):
#     print('|'  + ' '*pre +  '\\' + ' '*post +'|')
#     pre +=1 
#     post -=1 

# Pattern Print - N
# Given an integer n (where n > 0), print an "N" shaped pattern with n rows. The pattern should have vertical bars (|) on the left and right sides of each row, with a backslash (\) moving diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right. There should be no spaces to the right of the pattern.

# NOTE: This is an I/O type question, you need to write the whole code for taking input and printing the output.

# Input Format

#     • A single integer n, representing the number of rows in the pattern.

# Output Format

#     • An "N" shaped pattern with n rows, as described.

# Examples

# Input:

# 1
# Output:

# |\|
# Input:

# 2
# Output:

# |\ |
# | \|
# Input:

# 3
# Output:

# |\  |
# | \ |
