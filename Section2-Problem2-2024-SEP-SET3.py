#Another method:

# n=int(input())
# l=[]
# for i in range(n):
#     l.append(input())
# s=[]
# if n%2==0:
#     end=len(l)
# else:
#     end=len(l)-1
# for i in range(0,end,2):
#     s.append(l[i+1][::-1])
#     s.append(l[i])
# if n%2!=0:
#     s.append(l[-1][::-1])

# for i in range(n): 
#     print(s[i])

# Swap Every Alternate Line and Reverse Odd Lines
# Given multiple lines of input, modify the lines as follows:

#     • Swap every two consecutive lines.

#     • Reverse every odd-numbered line in the output sequence.

# NOTE: This is an I/O type question, you need to write the whole code for taking input and printing the output.

# Input Format:

#     • The first line contains the integer n, the number of lines.

#     • The next n lines contain text strings.

# Output Format:

#     • Print the transformed lines according to the rules specified.

# Example

# For the input:

# 5
# apple
# orange
# pineapple
# mango
# kiwi
# The output should be:

# egnaro
# apple
# ognam
# pineapple
# iwik
# Explanation:

#     • The first and second lines are swapped, with the first line (orange) reversed.

#     • The third and fourth lines are swapped, with the third line (mango) reversed.

#     • The fifth line (kiwi), being alone, is reversed.
